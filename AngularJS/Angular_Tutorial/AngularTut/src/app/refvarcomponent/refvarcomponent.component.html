<p>
  Just like how we given the reference to the element and accessing its value and other dom related function. Similary
  we can access the component data by giving the reference variable to the component.
</p>

<div>
  <!-- accessing the reference componnent variable -->
  <childdetail *ngIf="childcomps.selectedPeople" [selectedComp]="selectedPeople" />
  <!-- giving the reference to the component -->
  <childcomponent #childcomps />
</div>
